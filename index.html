				<h1>Q: What is <str‘void’ in a method declaration</str>? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</h1>
			<p class="custom">1) Void within the code ‘public static void main(String[] args) {}’ literally means that the method itself (that line of co</p>
			<p class="custom">de) has no return value. If you were to compile and run that code with nothing in between the code block then there would be</p>
			<p class="custom">no output returned to the display. On the other hand, if you were to declare a method with a return type then you wouldn’t u</p>
			<p class="custom">se void and might use int or something else which would have a return value.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
			<h1>Q: When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.</h1>
			<p class="custom">2) How would you use ‘=‘, ‘==‘, and .equals? Well, ‘=‘ is used to assign a value to a variable. If you were to use ‘==‘ inste</p>
			<p class="custom">ad of ‘=‘ it wouldn’t work because it would be comparing the two, not assigning a value to the variable. An example of how</p>
			<p class="custom">to use ‘=‘ to assign a value to a variable is as follows: myAge = 30; Now, whenever I would invoke myAge it would be tied to</p>
			<p class="custom">the value 30. For example, if I were to use System.out.println(“I’m “ + myAge + “.”); —— It would display “I’m 30.” You would</p>
			<p class="custom">use ‘==‘ in order to compare integers, chars, and booleans, etc. For example: 4 == 5 The above integers would be compared and </p>
			<p class="custom">the statement would be determined to be false. It also would not assign the value 5 to 4 because in this case 4 is not being</p>
			<p class="custom">used as a variable as the previous example. Finally, you would use ‘.equals’ to verify to see if two Strings have the same val</p>
			<p class="custom">ue. If you were to use ‘==‘ then you would not be able to verify if they had the same value properly as it would return</p>
			<p class="custom">false. For example, it’s true that: </p>
			<p class="custom">String slacker = “Fred”; String slacker has the same value as String worker. String worker = “Fred”; But if you were to do slacker.equals(worker);</p>
			<p class="custom">it would be a false statement.</p>

			<h1>Q: What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?</h1>
			<p class="custom">3) When you ‘import.java.util.Scanner’ into your code you invoke the ability to utilize a text scanner that is able to derive information from user input by typing</p>
			<p class="custom">something like this into code: Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in); if(kb != null) {System.out.print("Please enter your text here: "); String yourText = kb.next();</p>
			<p class="custom">The code above would derive any user input after being prompted by the machine and assign it to the variable ‘yourText’. The function comes from Java legacy code as it</p>
			<p class="custom">is one of the utilities (tools) inherent within the language.</p>

			<h1>Q: What does it mean to 'cast a double into an int'? When might you do this, and what is happening? </h1>
			<p class="custom">4) When you cast a double into an int it literally cuts off any decimal values that might have been on the end of the double. A good example of when you might use this </p>
			<p class="custom">is if you are a teacher and you need a program to help figure out what grades students get on papers. It could be easier to classify the grades by cutting off the decimals </p>
			<p class="custom"> that the teacher would get from the cumulated percentage of their students work. A generous teacher might use the code below. Example: double studentGrade = 89.89;</p>
			<p class="custom">studentGrade = (int) Math.round(studentGrade); Int finalGrade = (int) studentGrade;</p>

		</div>
		<div class="post">
			<h1>Q: When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?'</h1>
			<p class="custom">5) A parameter is any variable that is defined within a method and the argument is any specific value that is passed into a parameter. Example: public class ExampleParameterArgs </p>
			<p class="custom">public static int example(int a, int b) { // ‘a’ and ‘b’ are parameters here return a + b; } public static void main(String[] args) { int a = 10; int b = 20; int sum = add(a, b); </p>
			<p class="custom">// ‘a’ and ‘b’ are arguments here System.out.println(“Sum of a + b is: “ + sum);</p>
			</p>
