				<h1>Q: What is <str‘void’ in a method declaration</str>? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</h1>
				<p>1) Void within the code ‘public static void main(String[] args) {}’ literally means that the method itself (that line of code) has no return value. If you were to compile and run that code with nothing in between the code block then there would be
					no output returned to the display. On the other hand, if you were to declare a method with a return type then you wouldn’t use void and might use int or something else which would have a return value.</p>

				<h1>Q: When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.</h1>
				<p>2) How would you use ‘=‘, ‘==‘, and .equals? Well, ‘=‘ is used to assign a value to a variable. If you were to use ‘==‘ instead of ‘=‘ it wouldn’t work because it would be comparing the two, not assigning a value to the variable. An example of how
					to use ‘=‘ to assign a value to a variable is as follows: myAge = 30; Now, whenever I would invoke myAge it would be tied to the value 30. For example, if I were to use System.out.println(“I’m “ + myAge + “.”); —— It would display “I’m 30.” You would
					use ‘==‘ in order to compare integers, chars, and booleans, etc. For example: 4 == 5 The above integers would be compared and the statement would be determined to be false. It also would not assign the value 5 to 4 because in this case 4 is not being
					used as a variable as the previous example. Finally, you would use ‘.equals’ to verify to see if two Strings have the same value. If you were to use ‘==‘ then you would not be able to verify if they had the same value properly as it would return
					false. For example, it’s true that: String slacker = “Fred”; String slacker has the same value as String worker. String worker = “Fred”; But if you were to do slacker.equals(worker); it would be a false statement.</p>

				<h1>Q: What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?</h1>
				<p>3) When you ‘import.java.util.Scanner’ into your code you invoke the ability to utilize a text scanner that is able to derive information from user input by typing something like this into code: Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in); if(kb != null){
					System.out.print("Please enter your text here: "); String yourText = kb.next(); The code above would derive any user input after being prompted by the machine and assign it to the variable ‘yourText’. The function comes from Java legacy code as it
					is one of the utilities (tools) inherent within the language.

				<h1>Q: What does it mean to 'cast a double into an int'? When might you do this, and what is happening? </h1>
				<p>When you cast a double into an int it literally cuts off any decimal values that might have been on the end of the double. A good example of when you might use this is if you are a teacher and you need a program to help figure out what grades students
					get on papers. It could be easier to classify the grades by cutting off the decimals that the teacher would get from the cumulated percentage of their students work. A generous teacher might use the code below. Example: double studentGrade = 89.89;
					studentGrade = (int) Math.round(studentGrade); Int finalGrade = (int) studentGrade;</p>

				<h1>Q: When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?'</h1>
				<p>Q5) A parameter is any variable that is defined within a method and the argument is any specific value that is passed into a parameter. Example: public class ExampleParameterArgs public static int example(int a, int b) { // ‘a’ and ‘b’ are parameters
					here return a + b; } public static void main(String[] args) { int a = 10; int b = 20; int sum = add(a, b); // ‘a’ and ‘b’ are arguments here System.out.println(“Sum of a + b is: “ + sum);
